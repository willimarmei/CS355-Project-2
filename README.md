CS355 Project #1
 
Objectives
Develop a database and web application of your own design. You will design, define load test data into your database. And then use your web application to insert data and view it. Select an application that is either real or imaginary, business or personal. It should be simple but not trivial.
 
Proposal - Due Tuesday, March 6th
(5 points) Submit a proposal describing the application you will implement, describing in non-technical terms the function/use of your database. You don't need to provide completed SQL queries or tables, just a paragraph describing the purpose of your database. 
Limit 1 page, 1 side.  It must be typed and clear.
 
Project - Due Tuesday, April 17th
Design the database described in your proposal. The design must satisfy these requirements:
(25 Points) Schema Design & Implementation
(5 points) Create an Entity-Relationship diagram using Draw.io or another diagramming application. 
(5 points) Create a Relational Schema based on your Entity-Relationship diagram Draw.io or another diagramming application.  
(5 points) It must have at least 4 tables.  Most projects will require more.
(5 points) All primary, unique, and foreign key constraints must be specified wherever appropriate.
(5 points) Implement the database, loading a reasonably substantial number of rows into each table, enough to fully demonstrate its design, use, and correctness of the queries.
(25 Points) SQL Queries
(5 points) A query utilizing a JOIN between at least three different tables.
(5 points) A seperate query using ORDER BY
(5 points) Queries to INSERT values into each of your tables
(5 points) VIEWs which used by the web application to display the results from each of your tables
(5 points) At least one stored procedure. 
(25 Points) Web pages
(10 points) A set a web pages that allow users to populate the data in your database tables.
(10 points) At least one page should use a stored procedure to insert data into your tables.  Although it will be easier if each uses a stored procedure
(10 points) A set of web pages that display the results from each of your tables using the database VIEWs you created.  You do not need to have individual web pages for lookup tables as long as your other forms insert data into them.  Lookup tables are tables that were generated from your Many to Many relationships or your 1:1 relationships that were Partial Participation on both sides.
(20 points) Formal Report


A detailed overview of the purpose of your database. All business rules should be laid out in this section of your report.
Your entity-relationship diagram and relational schema.
An English description of each table, attribute, and key (primary, unique, and foreign).
An English description of each of your sql queries, and why they are meaningful/useful.
Screenshots showing an instance of the database (the tables). Layout the screenshots to make them as presentable as possible.
Screenshots showing each sql queries, including queries, output, results, new relations, changes to data, etc. where appropriate.
A link to your github or bitbucket account where your web application source code resides.
Assignments will be graded on correctness, completeness, clarity, and overall design quality. English descriptions should be clear, concise and written in your own words. The quality, organization, and readability of your presentation will be a sizable part of your grade.
You may submit your project by printing it out and handing it in or emailing it to me in a commonly used format such as Word or PDF.
